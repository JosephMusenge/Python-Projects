# Python Projects

Welcome to my Python Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of Python projects that showcase various programming concepts, algorithms, and practical applications using the Python programming language. These projects were designed to help me (and you) improve my Python skills, learn new techniques, and explore different domains within Python development.

## Project List

1. Project 1: Mean, Mode, and Median Calculator
2. Project 2: Rolling Dice Simulator
3. Project 3: URL Shortener

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
